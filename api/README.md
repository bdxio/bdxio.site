# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

### `develop`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

```
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

### `start`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload disabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-start)

```
npm run start
# or

```

```

# or
yarn build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment

Strapi is currently deployed on GCP. The project is hosted under `bdxio` organization, project `bdxio-strapi`.

If you want to deploy again,

- make sure [`gcloud` is installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and that you are logged in with your bdx.io account
- provide the `app.yml` with the environment variables on GCP. ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit them ‚ö†Ô∏è
- launch the following command to deploy: `gcloud app deploy app.yml --project bdxio-strapi`

If you need to check the logs on the server, you can watch them live with the command `gcloud app logs tail --project=bdxio-strapi -s default`.

### Troubleshooting

#### White page and console error after a fresh deploy

Remove the `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` if there is one. Re-install using `npm` and try to deploy again.
